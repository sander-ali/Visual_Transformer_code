# Visual_Transformer_code
This is the code for training MNIST dataset using visual Transformers through PyTorch

The implementation is based on the paper "AN IMAGE IS WORTH 16X16 WORDS:TRANSFORMERS FOR IMAGE RECOGNITION AT SCALE"

The visual transformer original implementation is available at "https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch#efficient-attention"

This code shows you how to use visual transformer your own dataset or datasets available with pytorch. 

Feel free to use and modify.
